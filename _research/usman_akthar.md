Usman graduated from  Computer Science at  Kyung Hee University  (KHU)  in
South Korea, he brings a broad computer science experience to the team. He
works   in   the   intersection   of   Data   Management,   Distributed   Systems,   and
Specialized   Hardware,   intending   to   make   data-intensive   applications   more
efficient   in   the   cloud   and   datacenter.   

His   previous   experience   focuses   on enabling the cloud for data acquisition, persistence, and storage that aimed at
comprehensively mining human’s daily life. He  has experienced  in handling
unstructured   data   and   performing   analytics   on   the   data   generated   from
heterogeneous   resources   for   producing   personalized   health   and   wellness
support. His research areas include computational complexity of ride-pooling,
data acquisition and communication in cloud-centric IoT, Big data persistence,
management, wellness-based  cloud  platforms,  and  human  lifelog  monitoring
with behavior tracking.
